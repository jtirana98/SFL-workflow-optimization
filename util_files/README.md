For problem $P_b$ there are two implementations:

- using solver
- our implementation

You can choose whichever approach you prefere. To select search comment "SELECT ALGORITHM -- P_b ----- SELECT ONLY ONE" and follow the guide in the next four lines.

In script: algo2_toy.py is the implementation of algorithm 2 and it can be used for toy examples, like the one showed in Figure 4.
